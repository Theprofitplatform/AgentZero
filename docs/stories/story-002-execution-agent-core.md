        self.whitelist = whitelist
        self.resource_limits = resource_limits
        self.sandbox = SandboxEnvironment()

    async def execute(self, command: str, timeout: int = 300) -> ExecutionResult:
        """Execute command with security controls"""
        # Validate against whitelist
        # Set up sandbox environment
        # Apply resource limits
        # Execute with timeout
        # Capture outputs
        # Clean up resources

class SystemOperations:
    """System-level operations handler"""
    async def file_operation(self, operation: FileOp, path: str, data: Any = None):
        """Perform file system operations with validation"""

    async def process_operation(self, operation: ProcessOp, process_id: str):
        """Manage system processes"""

    async def network_operation(self, operation: NetworkOp, params: Dict):
        """Execute network operations"""

class DeploymentManager:
    """Automated deployment orchestration"""
    async def deploy(self, artifact: str, target: DeploymentTarget, config: Dict):
        """Execute deployment pipeline"""

    async def rollback(self, deployment_id: str):
        """Rollback to previous version"""

    async def health_check(self, deployment_id: str) -> HealthStatus:
        """Check deployment health"""
```

### Security Implementation
```python
class SandboxEnvironment:
    """Isolated execution environment"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.temp_dir = None
        self.process_group = None
        self.network_namespace = None

    async def setup(self) -> str:
        """Create isolated environment"""
        # Create temporary directory with restricted permissions
        # Set up process group for resource control
        # Configure network isolation (optional)
        # Return sandbox path

    async def cleanup(self):
        """Clean up sandbox resources"""

class ResourceLimiter:
    """Resource usage constraints"""
    def apply_limits(self, process: Process):
        # CPU limit (e.g., 50% of one core)
        # Memory limit (e.g., 512MB)
        # Disk I/O limit
        # Network bandwidth limit (if applicable)

COMMAND_WHITELIST = [
    r'^ls\s+[\w\-\.\/]+$',           # List directory
    r'^cat\s+[\w\-\.\/]+$',          # Read file
    r'^echo\s+.*$',                  # Echo text
    r'^python3?\s+[\w\-\.\/]+\.py',  # Run Python scripts
    r'^npm\s+(install|test|build)',  # NPM commands
    r'^docker\s+(ps|logs|stats)',    # Docker read-only
    # Add more patterns as needed
]
```

### Monitoring Implementation
```python
class ExecutionMonitor:
    """Real-time execution monitoring"""
    def __init__(self, metrics_collector: MetricsCollector):
        self.metrics_collector = metrics_collector
        self.active_executions: Dict[str, ExecutionState] = {}

    async def start_monitoring(self, execution_id: str, task: Task):
        """Begin monitoring execution"""
        self.active_executions[execution_id] = ExecutionState(
            task_id=task.id,
            start_time=datetime.now(),
            status="running",
            metrics={}
        )

    async def update_metrics(self, execution_id: str, metrics: Dict):
        """Update execution metrics"""
        # CPU usage
        # Memory usage
        # I/O statistics
        # Network activity

    async def complete_monitoring(self, execution_id: str, result: Any):
        """Finalize monitoring"""
        state = self.active_executions[execution_id]
        state.end_time = datetime.now()
        state.duration = (state.end_time - state.start_time).total_seconds()
        state.status = "completed" if result else "failed"

        # Send to metrics collector
        await self.metrics_collector.record_execution(state)
```

    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "test" in result.stdout

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_command_whitelist_rejection():
    """Test command rejected by whitelist"""
    agent = ExecutionAgent()
    with pytest.raises(SecurityException):
        await agent.execute_command("rm -rf /")

@pytest.mark.asyncio

    with pytest.raises(TimeoutException):
        await agent.execute_command("sleep 1000", timeout=1)

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_resource_limits():
    """Test resource limit enforcement"""
    agent = ExecutionAgent()
    # Test memory limit
    result = await agent.execute_command(
        "python -c 'a = [0] * 10**9'",  # Try to allocate 1GB
        resource_limits=ResourceLimits(memory_mb=100)
    )
    assert result.exit_code != 0

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_deployment_rollback():
    """Test deployment rollback functionality"""
    agent = ExecutionAgent()
    deployment_id = await agent.deploy("app:v2", "production")
    await agent.rollback(deployment_id)
    status = await agent.get_deployment_status("production")
    assert status.version == "app:v1"
```

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. Implement secure command execution (critical for safety)
2. Add basic system operations
3. Implement monitoring and logging
4. Add deployment automation
5. Complete integration with Hive
6. Comprehensive testing

### Security Considerations
- **Never** execute commands without validation
- Always use absolute paths
- Validate file permissions before operations
- Log all security-relevant events
- Implement rate limiting for operations
- Use least privilege principle

### Performance Considerations
- Use subprocess with async for non-blocking execution
- Implement connection pooling for database operations
- Cache frequently accessed resources
- Use streaming for large file operations
- Implement circuit breaker for external services

### Error Handling Strategy
```python
class ExecutionError(Exception):
    """Base exception for execution errors"""

class SecurityError(ExecutionError):
    """Raised for security violations"""

class TimeoutError(ExecutionError):
    """Raised when execution times out"""

class ResourceError(ExecutionError):
    """Raised when resource limits exceeded"""

class DeploymentError(ExecutionError):
    """Raised for deployment failures"""
```

## Dependencies
- `psutil` for process and system monitoring
- `aiofiles` for async file operations
